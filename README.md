The program implements a navigator. A user can:

1. create a new settlement on the right mouse button 
2. check settlements on the left mouse button 
3. type `road x` to build a road at `x` length between the checked settlements 
4. type `path` to calculate the distance between the checked settlements 

Here are some screenshots of the program:
